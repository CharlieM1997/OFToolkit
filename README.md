# OpenFlow Toolkit

Version 0.1.1
Current functionality:

* Select controller script
* Specify log level
* Set command-line arguments
* Connect to the VM via SSH

To-Do:

* Change the 'Run Script' functionality so that it either executes in an SSH Client connected to the Virtual OS, or in the Virtual OS's GUI
* Automatically opens X11, Mininet (if possible? It might be easier and time-saving to assume that the Virtual Network is already running) and an SSH Client
* Quick button to immediately access PuTTY settings for setup
* Add functionality for Topology file
* Add support for a transfer protocol so that the POX configuration is imported to the Virtual OS
* More, TBD later
